# sAppWebConf
This project is just to ease the development of the stampApp configurator and keep track of changes between me and colaborators.
This is a replica of what I have on the subversion, is not what is inside the HOME/docs in the robot.
Modifications of languages have to be added to languages/sAppConfLiterals.xml
